# Food for Thoughts

* Leverage the SDK to perform code detection even when user types in a simple text editor.

* Write an extension for your favorite code editor.

* Leverage MX Master 3 gesture detection (e.g. single tap on touch wheel) to display contextual menu (code completion for instance), share a code snippet..

* Use Slack / StackOverflow APIs to bridge with others.

* Enhance 3D object manipulation with hi-resolution wheel and thumb-wheel.

* Use the SDK, the Logitech C922 webcam and some Computer Vision magic to: monitor your activity (presence detection), attention span (gaze detection, keyboard/mouse activity) and provide recommendations, analytics, etc.
